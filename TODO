TODO:

Continue implementing the Pixel and PixelAccessor classes. 

Add the increment and decrement methods to the layout classes and the pixelAccessor.

Implement the const versions of the channel and channelAtIndex methods for the DynamicLayout and the CompoundLayout.

Write a full set of tests for the pixel and pixelAccessor.

Implement the MaskLayout class which simply takes a Pixel type as a template argument and holds a reference to it. It then just implements the channel() methods but also passes a mask to their template
argument.

Write a basic Image class that takes a layout as a template argument. It should have a data window and a display window. It should hold ane PixelAccessor class that will point to the start of the
data. At channelPointer method should allow the values in the pixel accessor to be set.
