Todo:
3) Tidy up the CompoundLayoutContainerBase and add comments to it.
4) Add a static isCompound and an isDynamic method to the layout baseclass that just checks the Derived::NumberOfLayouts and Derived::IsDynamic enums on the derived classes.
2) Get the CompoundLayoutContainer working correctly with DynamicLayouts and PixelLayouts that contain a DynamicLayout.
3) Change the implementation of the LayoutContainer::addChannels so that it takes a set of the new channels and the old ones and updates it's data values accordingly.
4) Implement a LayoutAccessor class. It needn't derive from channelAccessor but it should implement the same methods. That way, the CompoundLayoutContainer should be able to use them too...
Fill in the gaps and get it working...
4) Remove the runtime channel traits as they just convolute things.
